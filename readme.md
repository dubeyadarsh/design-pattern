## Factory
The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factory-design-pattern/)

## Builder
The Builder Pattern is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/builder-design-pattern/)

## Singleton
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/)

## Prototype
The Prototype Pattern is used to create a new object by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prototype-design-pattern/)

## Facade
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/facade-design-pattern/)

## Adapter
The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adapter-design-pattern/)

## Decorator
The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorator-design-pattern/)

## Observer
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-design-pattern/)

## State
The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/state-design-pattern/)

## Strategy
The Strategy Pattern allows a family of algorithms to be defined and encapsulated in such a way that they are interchangeable within that family. [Learn More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strategy-design-pattern/)
